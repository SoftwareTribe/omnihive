-- Socket.IO => Do not upgrade to 4.2.x from 4.1.3.  There are problems with the typings that break implementation.
-- @types/node => Stay on the latest of the Node that we support (i.e. @types/node ^14.x)
-- Electron => Electron 14 is out but is not compliant with any building or debugging process we are using.  Stay on 13.x.
-- Exit Hook => OmniHive "exit-hook" is now ESM-only as of 3.x.  Cannot upgrade past 2.x unless we go ESM.
-- Node IPC => OmniHive "node-ipc" is now ESM-only as of 10.x.  Cannot upgrade past 2.x unless we go ESM.
-- Read Pkg Up => OmniHive "read-pkg-up" is now ESM-only as of 8.x.  Cannot upgrade past 2.x unless we go ESM.
-- Tedious (MSSQL) => Tedious is untested with knex beyond version 11.x.  Once either they or we test it we can upgrade, but stay on 11.x until then.
-- Apollo Server/Server Express => We are untested past version 2.x.  3.x needs thorough testing first.
-- @graphql-tools => Do not do any major version updates of any @graphql-tools libraries until we go to Apollo 3.x.
-- NodeJS => We are certified on version 14.x.  Have not done testing on 16.x yet.
